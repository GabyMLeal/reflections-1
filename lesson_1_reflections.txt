Comparison helped to find out the difference between two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient
programmer in the long term?

Coz we can record the changes made each day and whenever we want to trace back 
and see what changes we have made we can go to the different versions of a file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: u get to decide when to save version
cons: u myt forget that you need to save it

Why do you think some vcs, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Coz App codes are composed of number of differnet files.

How you can use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to see different commit versions
git dif to compare two different versions
